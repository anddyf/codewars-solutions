### Problem:
<h2 id="task">Task</h2>
<p>Your challenge is to write a function named <code>getSlope</code>/<code>get_slope</code>/<code>GetSlope</code> that calculates the slope of the line through two points.</p>
<h2 id="input">Input</h2>
<p>Each point that the function takes in is an array 2 elements long. The first number is the x coordinate and the second number is the y coordinate.
If the line through the two points is vertical or if the same point is given twice, the function should return <code>null</code>/<code>None</code>.</p>
