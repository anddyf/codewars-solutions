### Problem:
<p>Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension <code>n</code> x <code>m</code> into small squares.
Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable.
Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.</p>
<p>For example if you are given a chocolate bar of size <code>2</code> x <code>1</code> you can split it to single squares in just one break, but for size <code>3</code> x <code>1</code> you must do two breaks.</p>
<p>If input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are needed if we do not have any chocolate to split). Input will always be a non-negative integer.</p>
