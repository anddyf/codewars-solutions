### Problem:
<p>#Get the averages of these numbers</p>
<p>Write a method, that gets an array of integer-numbers and return an array of the averages of each integer-number and his follower, if there is one.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>Input:  [ 1, 3, 5, 1, -10]
Output:  [ 2, 4, 3, -4.5]</code></pre><p>If the array has 0 or 1 values or is null or None, your method should return an empty array.</p>
<p>Have fun coding it and please don&apos;t forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)</p>
