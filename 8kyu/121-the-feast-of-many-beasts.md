### Problem:
<p>All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish. There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal&apos;s name. For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.</p>
<p>Write a function <code>feast</code> that takes the animal&apos;s name and dish as arguments and returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast.</p>
<p>Assume that <code>beast</code> and <code>dish</code> are always lowercase strings, and that each has at least two letters. <code>beast</code> and <code>dish</code> may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numerals.</p>
