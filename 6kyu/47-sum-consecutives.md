### Problem:
<p>You are given a list/array which contains only integers (positive and negative). Your job is to sum only the numbers that are the same and consecutive. The result should be one list.</p>
<p>Extra credit if you solve it in one line. You can asume there is never an empty list/array and there will always be an integer. </p>
<p>Same meaning: 1 == 1</p>
<p>1 != -1</p>
<p>#Examples:</p>
<pre><code>[1,4,4,4,0,4,3,3,1] # should return [1,12,0,4,6,1]

&quot;&quot;&quot;So as you can see sum of consecutives 1 is 1 
sum of 3 consecutives 4 is 12 
sum of 0... and sum of 2 
consecutives 3 is 6 ...&quot;&quot;&quot;

[1,1,7,7,3] # should return [2,14,3]
[-5,-5,7,7,12,0] # should return [-10,14,12,0]</code></pre>
