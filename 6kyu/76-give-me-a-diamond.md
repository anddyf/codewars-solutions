### Problem:
<p>Jamie is a programmer, and James&apos; girlfriend. She likes diamonds, and wants a diamond string from James. Since James doesn&apos;t know how to make this happen, he needs your help.</p>
<h2 id="task">Task</h2>
<p>You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed on the screen, using asterisk (<code>*</code>) characters. Trailing spaces should be removed, and every line must be terminated with a newline character (<code>\n</code>).</p>
<p>Return <code>null/nil/None/...</code> if the input is an even number or negative, as it is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>A size 3 diamond:</p>
<pre><code> *
***
 *</code></pre><p>...which would appear as a string of <code>&quot; *\n***\n *\n&quot;</code></p>
<p>A size 5 diamond:</p>
<pre><code>  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *</code></pre><p>...that is: <code>&quot;  *\n ***\n*****\n ***\n  *\n&quot;</code></p>
