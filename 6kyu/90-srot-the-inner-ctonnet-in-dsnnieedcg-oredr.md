### Problem:
<p>#Srot the inner ctnnoet in dsnnieedcg oredr</p>
<p>You have to sort the inner content of every word of a string in descending order.<br>
The inner content is the content of a word without first and the last char.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;sort the inner content in descending order&quot; -&gt; &quot;srot the inner ctonnet in dsnnieedcg oredr&quot;
&quot;wait for me&quot; -&gt; &quot;wiat for me&quot;
&quot;this kata is easy&quot; -&gt; &quot;tihs ktaa is esay&quot;</code></pre><p>The string will never be null and will never be empty.<br>
It will contain only lowercase-letters and whitespaces.<br><br>
In C++ the string is always 0-terminated.
